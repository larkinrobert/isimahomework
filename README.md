Use `pipenv install` to setup

This was completed in 5.5 hours in two sessions (2, 3.5), some of that time was spent on generating a dataset.

_Notes_

1)Picked up pipenv which was unknown to me when I was using python before. Similar to nodes npm and very usefull.
2)Discovered pandas and pandas_schema, both awesome. Previously I had no need for data validation while managing infrastructre.
3)Validation with pandas_schemas wasn't strictly instructed, but I wanted to try it.
4)I ran out of time and didn't get to setting up pylint.
